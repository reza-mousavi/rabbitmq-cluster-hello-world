# Machine Learning Practice

The project is created to practice ML techniques discussed on Digital AI

AL(ML) could be classified on two different directions
- Supervised Learning
	- Regression
	- Classification
- Advanced Algorithms
	- Neural Networks(Tensorfow)
	- Decision Tree
- Unsupervised Learning

The project utilizes the following technologies

- Python as the programming language
- scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Numpy and Pandas
- Jupyter Notebooks


## Supervised Learning

This the approach where Machine tries to learn based on human input(behaviour)

Common could be mentioned as

- Regression (Single and Multi Feature)
- Classification

# Python Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are great way to experiment any piece of Python code.

## Installing Requirements

Using pip and venv to manage requirements, depedencies could be obtained using the following commands
```console
foo@bar:~$ python -m venv py312
foo@bar:~$ py312\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Running Notebooks

Either on window or Linux run the Notebook server using the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ jupyter notebook
```
